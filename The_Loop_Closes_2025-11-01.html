    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="intro">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Today I closed the loop. The administration is done. The evidence is filed. The accounts are separated. The belongings are bagged. What remains is peace.</p>
        <p>This entry is not an argument. It is a line drawn in clean ink. I honour the effort it took to get here and I honour the part of me that kept asking for truth.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="reflection">
      <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I entered the relationship in good faith. I came to give love and to be met in love. What I met too often was avoidance framed as reflection and silence framed as care. I carried the emotional labour for both of us until there was nothing left to carry that did not cost me peace.</p>
        <p>There have been five cycles of this pattern. Naming that is not bitterness. It is clarity. I can see my own part as well. I stayed longer than was kind to myself. I believed the promise more than the practice. That lesson lands without self punishment. It lands as a standard for what I accept from now on.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="what-i-learned">
      <h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <ul>
          <li>Silence is a decision. It is not care.</li>
          <li>Boundaries are not threats. They are the conditions for love.</li>
          <li>Documentation protects reality when narratives start to bend.</li>
          <li>Love without reciprocity becomes self abandonment.</li>
          <li>Peace is not found. It is made through clear action.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="release">
      <h2 id="release">Release</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I release the hope that this would become what I needed. I release the urge to explain or seek acknowledgment. I release the role of caretaker and witness for someone who chose distance over dialogue. I return that work to the only person who can complete it.</p>
        <p>What remains is simple. I have acted with integrity. I have spoken plainly. I have recorded the facts. The rest is not mine.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="practice">
      <h2 id="practice">A simple practice for my body</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <ul>
          <li>Walk outside and feel ground under feet. Ten slow breaths. Shoulders down. Jaw soft.</li>
          <li>Stand in a warm shower for three minutes. Imagine the residue of this year rinsing away.</li>
          <li>Sit with Paddy for five quiet minutes. Let the rhythm of something loyal and alive steady my system.</li>
          <li>Eat something clean. Drink water. Early night.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="commitments">
      <h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <ul>
          <li>I choose relationships that meet me in presence, not performance.</li>
          <li>I keep my money, time, and home aligned with my values.</li>
          <li>I speak needs early. I leave when they cannot be met.</li>
          <li>I protect peace as a daily practice, not a slogan.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="closing">
      <h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>The pattern ends here. The loop is closed. I step back into my own life and let the quiet do its work.</p>
