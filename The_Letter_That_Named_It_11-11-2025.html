    <section class="card-like">
      <p>Today, for the first time, the words exist on headed paper:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “The overall clinical picture is most consistent with a vaccine-related neuro inflammatory or thrombo embolic event temporally associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is hard to describe what it feels like to see that sentence, the one I have carried alone for four years, finally written, signed, and stamped with professional authority. For so long I have been treated like a difficult patient, a problem to be managed, or worse, someone imagining things that were happening in plain sight inside my own body.</p>
      <p>And now, a consultant neurologist, calm and meticulous, has said what I have always known. Not as comfort, but as fact.</p>
      <p>The relief is not loud. It is quieter than I expected. Almost hollow. Like the body can finally stop bracing for disbelief. I keep re reading the letter, not to prove anything anymore, but to let it sink in that the war for recognition is over.</p>
      <p>It does not undo the harm or return what was taken, health, time, trust, but it does something subtler, it restores reality. It gives shape to the invisible.</p>
      <p>I think of Natasha, her quiet kindness and patience, the small human bridge that helped this letter onto paper. And of Dr Malik, who did not turn away, who wrote exactly what was true.</p>
      <p>There is a strange peace in that. A line drawn under years of distortion. My name, my injury, my truth, now in the clinical record where it always belonged.</p>
      <p>Maybe tonight I do not need to analyse it. Maybe I just need to breathe, hold my Paddy close, and know that this page means I was right to <strong>survive.</strong></p>
