      <p>
        For too long, I have stood between two distorted mirrors, one casting me as a victim and the other naming me unwell. Both were wrong. I am not fragile, and I am not the problem. I am the one who noticed what others refused to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have walked through manipulation, silence, and cruelty disguised as love. I was told to doubt my memory, my intuition, and my worth. What they called instability was often my instinct fighting to stay alive inside systems that demanded compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am done explaining, defending, or apologising for the ways I survived. I have earned the right to speak plainly. I am not mentally ill. I am mentally awake. My pain does not make me broken. It makes me capable of seeing clearly in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a story of damage. It is the story of someone who faced distortion and still chose truth. I am not a victim. I am a witness. From here, I become the author.
