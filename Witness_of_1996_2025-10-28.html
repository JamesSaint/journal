        <p>
          I ran the coroner papers through a machine to see what I already knew. The output came back clean, aligned, and clinical. It mirrored the patterns I have carried in my body for nearly thirty years. It did not flinch. It did not soothe. It told the truth that the documents could bear and left the remaining weight with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entry sits beside the factual matrix, not to restate it but to record the human impact. It is my witness statement as a son. It belongs next to the reconstruction I built:

        <p>
          I accept that the file will never hold everything. It can hold injuries, levels, and timings. It cannot hold the cost of being told to put a lid on the past. It cannot hold the way my mother’s absence kept rearranging the furniture of my life. It cannot hold the decades I spent wondering if I was allowed to trust my own perception.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I can do is keep the factual record accurate and keep my witness alive. Both matter. The record honours reality. My witness restores dignity.
