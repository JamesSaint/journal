    <article class="section card-like" aria-labelledby="entry-title">
      <p>I saw the pattern early. The contradictions, the control dressed as care, the same energetic climate that destroyed my mother, I recognised it in her. I tried to trust the part of me that knew, and I also tried to believe her promises to heal. Both instincts were real.</p>

      <p>I stayed because I hoped awareness could change behaviour. I wanted to believe therapy, reflection, and love could undo the damage she carried. I stayed because I was willing to meet pain with presence, and because I did not want to abandon someone I thought was trying.</p>

      <p>Throughout 2024 and 2025, every boundary I placed was tested. Each time I said no, she found a new way to wrap control in empathy. Even as I pulled back, she drew me in with the rhetoric of growth, I am in therapy, I am learning, I am changing. It was hope that kept me there, not blindness.</p>

      <p>Leaving was not one moment, it was a series of awakenings, October 2024, January 2025, July 2025, and finally October 2025. Each time I saw the truth more clearly, until the story of healing no longer matched the evidence. What broke me was not a single act, but the slow recognition that she did not want transformation, she wanted admiration for pretending to transform.</p>

      <p>I left because I could finally tell the difference between compassion and self betrayal. I left because my body could not survive another cycle of promises. I left because the truth mattered more than being understood.</p>

      <p>This time, the pattern ends with me. My mother’s story will not be mine.</p>
