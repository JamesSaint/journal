<h2>Chapter 8 – Searching for Connection (2023 – 2024)</h2>
<p>When the fence went up, the garden looked finished, but inside me there was still emptiness. The noise from the neighbours, the cost-of-living headlines, the endless grey skies — it all pressed in. I had done everything I could to rebuild a space, yet what I really wanted was another person who could see me. Not pity me. See me.</p>
<p>Money was becoming tight. The government called it a cost-of-living crisis; to me it felt like the slow tightening of a noose. My savings drained with each repair, each delivery, each bill. I looked at my van and thought about the work I used to do — heating, plumbing, electrics. On paper, I was still a qualified gas engineer, though all my certifications had expired.</p>
<p>I started following a local training company online, <strong>Hampshire Training and Assessments</strong>, the kind of place that refreshed engineers’ qualifications. I thought, <em>maybe I can’t crawl under floorboards anymore, but I can teach</em>. I knew my trade inside out. Maybe I could train new entrants and earn an income that didn’t destroy my body.</p>
<p>One day I just walked in. A man named Pat met me at the door, and I told him my story — that I wasn’t well, that my qualifications had lapsed, but that I wanted to contribute. He introduced me to the owner, who liked my initiative. They gave me a chance: sit in on a few training sessions, watch how the instructors work. For the first time in years, I walked into a building full of people.</p>
<p>For a week or two, I shadowed the trainers. I was nervous, but the old knowledge was still there — the safety regs, the combustion equations, the knack for explaining complicated systems in plain language. The feedback came back positive: <em>He knows his stuff. He connects well. He’d make a good trainer.</em></p>
<p>The owner offered me a job — forty-three thousand a year, Monday to Friday, eight to five — but there was a condition. I’d need to pay for my re-qualification course up front. Once I passed, the job would be mine. I wanted to believe him, but something inside recoiled. I didn’t have that kind of money, and even if I did, it felt wrong that I should take all the risk while he took none. I tried to negotiate — maybe he could pay half and take the rest from my wages — but I couldn’t find the words. My anxiety scrambled everything. Later I learned he’d been burned before by someone else. His boundary was fixed. I had to respect it. But when I walked away, I felt like I’d failed again.</p>
<p>Spring came. The cold gave way to light. I went to the beach more often — sometimes just to sit, sometimes to swim. The cold water bit into my skin and made me feel alive. It was there, in May, that I met <strong>Rachel</strong>. She was sixty-eight, looked mid-fifties, confident, tanned, free. We got talking, discovered we both loved naturism, and before long we were spending time together — the beach, her flat, my house. After years of being unseen, I was suddenly seen, completely, even naked. It was healing at first.</p>
<p>But patterns have gravity. I began to notice how much I was giving, how little she offered back. I was her comfort, her novelty, her summer story. She once said she didn’t expect it to last more than eighteen months — that her looks would fade and I’d leave. I realised she was already halfway gone. When I finally left, it was quiet, no fight, just another goodbye that felt like relief.</p>
<p>Ten days later I met <strong>Frankie</strong>. Thirty-seven, newly divorced, recently back from Australia, no children, living with family. We met for coffee, walked around, and she practically threw herself into my arms. It was flattering, overwhelming, confusing. My body wanted closeness; my mind wanted caution. I left that first meeting uneasy, but I went back.</p>
<p>Between October 2023 and the spring of 2024, we were together. It was love mixed with labour. She was grieving her marriage, still entangled with her ex, using me as a place to collapse. I tried to hold her grief, to be the safe one again. The more I gave, the emptier I became. One night she lay next to me crying for her husband, and I knew I was finished. I told her she could do that on her own time. Then I left.</p>
<p>When it ended, I was wrecked — physically, emotionally, financially. I went back to the rhythm I knew: beach, home, beach, home, trying to heal under the sun. People kept telling me I was a good man, that I just needed to find the right person to receive what I offered. But all I felt was alone.</p>
<p>And then, one afternoon, I reinstalled Tinder. Two profiles stopped me. One was a woman too stunning to be real. The other was <strong>Jo</strong>. She wasn’t the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, but there was something in her eyes, in the way she wrote about herself — depth, self-awareness, something spiritual. I swiped right on both. When my phone buzzed a few minutes later, I knew instinctively it was her. <em>“Divergent thinker made me smile,”</em> she wrote. <em>“How are you?”</em></p>
