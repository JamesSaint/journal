<h2>Chapter 9 – Meeting Jo (Summer 2024)</h2>
<p>We started messaging back and forth. Hours passed like minutes. For eight hours that first day, words bounced between us—curiosity, humour, stories. She said later that she could sense how wounded I was, that she could feel it through the screen. I was open about it. I told her I wasn’t going to get caught in another loop of over-giving. I said, <em>I’m done being the one who rescues while the other takes.</em> She replied, <em>Not all women are like that.</em></p>
<p>She told me she worked at J.P. Morgan as a Managing Director, that she earned a good salary and had built her own life from nothing after a brutal marriage breakdown. She said she wasn’t looking for a man to fund her, only someone she could actually connect with. That difference—her financial independence, her self-presentation as a woman who provided rather than took—disarmed me.</p>
<p>For three weeks we talked while she was away on holiday in a shepherd’s hut somewhere in Sussex. The GPS on Tinder had placed us sixteen kilometres apart, though in truth we were nearly a hundred miles away—she in London, me on the coast. Every day we wrote. Every day it grew. But when she came back from holiday, reality hit me: the distance.</p>
<p>One night I sat at my computer, pulled up Google Maps, and calculated it: two hours’ drive between us. I took a screenshot and sent it to her. I told her I liked her, that she seemed lovely, but that I couldn’t do another long-distance relationship. I said goodbye.</p>
<p>She didn’t accept it. The message landed, but instead of pulling away, she reached back. She said she didn’t want to lose me, that distance didn’t have to mean impossibility. Part of me knew she was right; another part of me knew I should stop before I was pulled in again. But neither of us let go.</p>
<p>Finally she suggested we meet halfway. “Box Hill?” she said. “I’ll drive an hour; you drive an hour.”</p>
<h3>Box Hill</h3>
<p>It was a warm day, high summer. I arrived first, parked, and saw her getting her boots out of the car. Blonde hair, black jeans, focused on her laces. She said later that she could feel my energy before she saw me. We started walking, winding through the hills and woods, talking about everything—childhood, work, belief, the things we’d survived.</p>
<p>It was during that walk she told me about her children. How she’d never bonded with her daughter. How her son had been conceived to spare the man she loved from the loneliness of being an only child. It was a strange confession for a first meeting, but I understood it: she wanted to be heard by someone who wouldn’t judge her. I listened.</p>
<p>We got lost and found our way back again. We laughed easily. When the café at the top closed, we sat on a bench, still talking. When it got dark we walked toward our cars. At the edge of the car park we stopped and hugged—a long, wordless, forty-five-minute embrace that neither of us wanted to end. Halfway through, rain started to fall, but neither of us moved.</p>
<p>I’d promised myself that this time would be different—no touching, no kissing, no sex for ninety days. I’d seen that advice somewhere, a way to break trauma loops and protect the heart. But there I was, standing in the rain, breaking the rule.</p>
<p>When we finally kissed, it was deep and electric. We were soaked through. I opened the boot of my car to grab towels—mostly kept there for Paddy, but clean. We dried ourselves, laughed, and kissed again. One thing led to another, the energy of the moment too strong to resist. There were people in the car park, horns honking, shouts of “Oi oi!”, but we barely noticed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, drenched and breathless, we said goodbye, got into our cars, and drove home. Neither of us remembered much of the drive—only the high of connection, the flood of chemicals, the feeling that something enormous had begun.</p>
<p>Over the next weeks we kept messaging, voice notes, phone calls that ran late into the night. Then she had a work trip to Bournemouth. Her job often took her there for meetings, overnight in hotels. She invited me to meet her. The trains were down that week, so I offered to pick her up in Winchester and drive us to Bournemouth. We reached the hotel and barely made it through the door before clothes were on the floor. Passionate, urgent, alive. We ordered room service, ate in bed, talked until we fell asleep in a bed the size of an island.</p>
<p>In the morning she went to her meetings and I drove home. She called me that evening, confused that she hadn’t asked me to stay. A day later her PA booked a car to drive her back to London. She thought about stopping to see me but couldn’t face it. I wanted her to come, but I was terrified of her seeing how bare my house was—just one furnished room, my bedroom. I didn’t want her to know how thin my life had become.</p>
<p>She drove past. It bothered her. She called that night and said she wished she’d come. A week later she did. She arrived by train. I picked her up, brought her home. I let her see the house, the emptiness. She didn’t flinch. She stayed six days—Zoom calls by day, conversation and closeness by night. When she left on Monday, a friend told her, “Six days? That’s a commitment for you.” The comment triggered her. Intimacy frightened her more than loneliness.</p>
<p>Within days she withdrew—quiet, distant, self-protecting. I recognised it. I called her and named it: dismissive-avoidant loops, the push–pull cycle. She said later the truth cracked her open. It also set the next year into motion.</p>
