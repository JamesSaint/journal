<h2>Chapter 5 – The Descent (July 2021 – January 2022)</h2>
<p>After Dr Mitchell left, I was assigned to a new psychiatrist, Dr Temi Oyeyemedi. Our first call was in October 2021. His tone was brisk, his words clipped. I was already hanging by a thread, but in his voice I heard dismissal. I tried to explain that my body felt hijacked, that the pain and the fog were unbearable, that I couldn’t think or move. He cut through my sentences, his manner cold. By the time the call ended I felt erased.</p>
<p>Those months were a slow death in instalments. I could barely wash myself. I couldn’t think clearly enough to read or watch television. Every nerve in my body felt lit from within. The left side of my head burned and buzzed as if electricity ran through it. I would lie in bed for hours, unable to move, trying to quiet a nervous system that refused to obey.</p>
<p>I remember turning off my phone one night and curling up on the bed convinced that I was about to die. I waited for it. I didn’t want another morning. But morning came, and Paddy needed feeding, and the simple truth of his need reached me when nothing else could. He looked at me with those soft, steady eyes, and I realised he was the only reason I was still here. I got up for him, not for me.</p>
<p>The world outside still frightened me. Each attempt to walk him ended with panic—dogs rushing up, people too close, every noise a threat. I withdrew again, living behind drawn curtains, surviving in a small radius from bed to kettle to back door. The pain stayed, the exhaustion deepened. No follow-up. No examination. No one connecting the dots that a stroke had already happened inside my skull.</p>
<p>I tried to make sense of it on my own. I wrote down every symptom, every flash of pain. I convinced myself it might be Guillain-Barré syndrome; I’d read that vaccines could trigger it. I phoned the Guillain-Barré charity and spoke to a kind woman who said my symptoms sounded similar but that, by now, any markers would have disappeared. She couldn’t diagnose, only listen. Even that small act of being heard felt like medicine.</p>
<p>I stayed indoors through the rest of 2021. The nights were long and silent except for the pounding in my head. Then one day, somewhere near the end of the year, I listened to an audiobook—Laura Doddsworth’s <em>A State of Fear</em>. Hearing her voice describe how fear had been used to control the public during the pandemic cracked something open in me. It named what I had felt all along: that the terror around me wasn’t natural, it was cultivated. For the first time in months, I felt sane.</p>
<p>The relief was mixed with fury. Realising how deliberately fear had been sown made my isolation make sense, but it also underlined how cruelly I’d been left to fend for myself. Every text from the GP urging another jab, every message from my sister asking if I’d had my booster, landed like proof that the world had moved on and I hadn’t. So I stopped replying. I disappeared.</p>
<p>Only Paddy remained—a silent witness, breathing beside me, keeping me tethered to life.</p>
<p>By the start of 2022, another pain began under my jaw. My submandibular gland had swollen again, pus leaking into my mouth. I remembered the surgery years earlier, the tiny tool the professor had used to spare me a scar. Now the duct was blocked again. I phoned the GP for antibiotics, swallowed them, and a few days later passed a hard white stone—five millimetres long, jagged as guilt. The infection cleared, but the deeper sickness did not.</p>
<p>By then I was taking forty milligrams of diazepam a day and zopiclone each night just to keep my heart from racing out of my chest. I was a ghost moving through the rooms of a house I no longer recognised. And yet somewhere beneath the chemicals and the noise, a thought began to form: <em>if I stay on these pills, the system still owns me</em>.</p>
<p>That thought would become the next battle—the long, painful withdrawal that would either destroy me or give me back my name.</p>
