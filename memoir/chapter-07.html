<h2>Chapter 7 – Reclamation (November 2022 – February 2023)</h2>
<p>When the fog of withdrawal began to lift, the world came back in pieces—light through a window, the sound of the sea miles away, the weight of Paddy’s head on my knee. I was still frightened of leaving the house, still in pain, but there was a small sense of agency again. I could decide what to do with a day.</p>
<p>It started with the garden. One November morning I looked out at the overgrown patch of land behind the house and thought, <em>If I can’t fix myself, maybe I can fix this.</em> The grass had choked out the soil, the shrubs had turned feral, and rubble from the builders was buried under the surface. I wanted a place where Paddy and I could sit in the sun come spring.</p>
<p>I began slowly. My muscles screamed when I lifted the first spade of soil, but the rhythm of physical work gave my mind something it hadn’t had in years: focus. Bucket by bucket I dug, unearthed bricks, nails, twisted metal, and chunks of timber the builders had simply buried. Fourteen tons in total, carried by hand into the one-ton bags that a local company—Webb’s Waste—came to collect. Each bag they hauled away felt like a layer of damage removed from both the ground and me.</p>
<p>The neighbours never changed. The kids behind the fence still screamed and kicked their footballs. The man on the other side, David, still filled the air with the howl of his angle grinder and leaf blower. Ninety-six decibels of DIY from eight in the morning until evening. I tried to see it as background noise, but most days it felt like punishment. Paddy had learned to fear the sound of their voices; at the first shout he would bolt back inside.</p>
<p>Still, I kept digging. When my body couldn’t take it, I hired help. A tree-maintenance crew came to reduce the overgrown hedges, and one of them gave me the number of a fence builder. The fence I had was rotting, leaning, a perfect metaphor for how things had been. In February 2023, after months of scraping money together, I hired him to put up a new boundary—concrete posts, concrete gravel boards, uniform panels running in a straight, solid line.</p>
<p>The day it went up, the garden looked smaller but cleaner, defined. I stood there in the cold and thought: <em>This is mine. This line is mine.</em> It wasn’t happiness exactly, but it was a beginning.</p>
<p>The work rebuilt more than the garden. My body, weak from years of illness and medication, started to find strength again. The ache in my muscles was honest; it came from effort, not injury. I could see shape in my arms again. I started sleeping a little, the kind of sleep that comes after real work rather than from a pill.</p>
<p>It was the first time in a long while that my actions created visible change. I had dug out the buried rubble and replaced it with order. I’d drawn a line around my space. It was a small act of reclamation, but it was mine.</p>
