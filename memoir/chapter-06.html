<h2>Chapter 6 – Withdrawal (February – November 2022)</h2>
<p>By February 2022 I was held together by pills and habit. Forty milligrams of diazepam a day, zopiclone at night, and a house that barely felt real. I couldn’t drive safely, couldn’t focus long enough to read, and couldn’t imagine any future that didn’t include another refill slip from the GP.</p>
<p>One night, restless and angry, I started searching online. That’s how I found <strong>Professor Heather Ashton’s manual</strong> on benzodiazepine withdrawal. I read about GABA receptors, dependency, the way the brain down-regulates its own calming chemistry until it can’t function without the drug. I realised that what I had called “my anxiety” might simply be my body’s reaction to a substance it had never learned to live without.</p>
<p>The manual described how to come off slowly. It said the process would take months, even a year, and that it would feel worse before it felt better. It warned of insomnia, crawling sensations under the skin, heightened pain, and surges of fear. It also promised that freedom was possible.</p>
<p>I decided I would do it alone. There was no doctor I trusted, and every official channel had already failed me. I began the slow arithmetic of cutting tablets. From forty milligrams to thirty-five. From thirty-five to thirty. Each reduction brought new withdrawal storms: nights without sleep, muscles twitching, a fizzing in my skin like static electricity. The less medication I took, the louder my nerves screamed.</p>
<p>At times I could feel every thread of pain in my body. It was as if the drugs had been muting the real injury underneath—the neurological damage I hadn’t known how to name. My head burned, my limbs trembled, my thoughts jolted like faulty wiring.</p>
<p>The months blurred together. I filled pages with notes about doses and symptoms. When I hit the halfway mark, I wanted to give up. But something stubborn in me kept going. Each small reduction was a step away from the system that had sedated me into silence.</p>
<p>Spring became summer, and I kept at it: thirty milligrams, twenty-five, twenty, ten. My sleep vanished entirely for stretches. I felt ants under my skin, electricity in my bones, a constant hum in my head. I barely ate, but my mind began to clear. For the first time in years I could see the outlines of myself again.</p>
<p>By late autumn I was down to half a milligram. I remember sitting on the edge of my bed with the last fragment of a tablet in my palm. I looked at it for a long time and decided that was it. I swallowed it dry and knew the next dose would be nothing.</p>
<p>The nights that followed were brutal. I didn’t sleep. My body ached in new places. But I was free. I had done what no doctor or service had managed to help me do. I was clear of the drugs that had kept me in chains.</p>
<p>When the worst of the physical withdrawal passed, I looked around at what remained. The house was still bare, the world still uncertain, but I was awake in it. For the first time in years, I felt the faint, clean pain of reality rather than the numb ache of sedation.</p>
<p>I told myself I’d lost another year, but at least this time the loss had purpose.</p>
