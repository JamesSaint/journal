<h2>Chapter 3 – The House and the Neighbours (October 2020 – February 2021)</h2>
<p>By winter, the quiet street that had promised refuge became a cage. The house still smelled of damp even after I’d patched the wall and scrubbed every surface. Every time I stepped outside, the noise returned—children screaming, balls slamming against the fence, a drumbeat of intrusion.</p>
<p>The back garden had been the reason I bought the place. It faced south, felt private, or could have. But the family behind treated the dividing fence as a goalpost. I’d hear the thud of leather, the whoop of voices, the shudder of impact against timber, hour after hour. The sound found its way inside me until my body clenched on instinct whenever it started.</p>
<p>David, the neighbour who’d once sat on my floor, became a familiar figure. He’d wander over under the guise of small talk, and I’d try to hold it together. One evening he knocked and found me undone again—crying, desperate, surrounded by half-finished repairs. I told him everything in a jumble: the smell, the noise, the exhaustion. He listened. He knew the previous owners had fought with those same neighbours. The history had been passed down like a curse.</p>
<p>I patched the wall again, lowered the ground outside, filled holes, painted over the damage. The house still felt unclean, but the rhythm of work gave me something to do. Amazon boxes piled up: filler, paint, disinfectant, screws, everything delivered because shops were shut. The national mood had turned grim. Briefings blared from every screen, the fear thick in the air. I absorbed it all.</p>
<p>I registered with the local GP and tried to explain how unwell I was—mentally, physically, emotionally. I spoke to a GP named <strong>Dr. Denby</strong>. I tried to explain my PTSD, that it dated back to 2016 when Julia died, and that the lockdown had reactivated everything. He replied with one word that stuck: “Still?” It landed like contempt.</p>
<p>After that I stopped trying to talk. I closed the door and shut down. Fireworks exploded that November, the bangs from nearby gardens merging with the football thuds and children’s shouts. My body reacted before my mind could. The sound hit my amygdala like an electric shock.</p>
<p>By December I was barely functioning. I received a letter: a phone assessment with the mental-health team, referred by Becky from Waverley Community Services. I was to be assessed over the phone—<em>due to COVID precautions</em>. The letter sat on the table for days before I opened it. When I finally spoke to them, I told the truth as best I could: that I couldn’t cope, that I was isolated, that every sound outside felt like an attack.</p>
<p>They documented it all, tidy clinical notes about a man with “long-standing PTSD and agoraphobia, not associating with other people.” They didn’t seem to hear that I was disappearing.</p>
<p>In February a letter arrived with a psychiatrist’s name: <strong>Dr. Denzel Mitchell</strong>. He would call me on March 24th, 2021. I marked it on the calendar like a lifeline.</p>
