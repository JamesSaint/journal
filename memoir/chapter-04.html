<h2>Chapter 4 – Collapse (March – July 2021)</h2>
<p>The letter said a psychiatrist would call me on March 24th. I waited like a man at the end of a rope. When Dr Denzel Mitchell finally rang, I tried to explain what my life felt like inside that house. The fear. The noise. The shut curtains. The body that would not settle. I told him I was drowning. He dictated a summary that later turned up in my post. It said I had long-standing PTSD, agoraphobia, and chronic anxiety. It said I preferred remote appointments and home delivery of medication. It said I had slipped into withdrawal after a short diazepam script from a colleague, which he took as evidence of dependence. It recommended olanzapine and zopiclone and asked my GP to keep the diazepam going.</p>
<p>I read those lines and felt small. I did not feel seen. I felt inventoried. Labels and plans. No one in the room. No one in my house. No one watching how my nervous system was stuck on a high setting I could not switch off.</p>
<p>Spring crept in. The country kept talking about vaccines like they were a ticket back to life. I was alone, frightened, and desperate for a door back to people. The GP surgery arranged home visits. Two nurses arrived at my front door with brisk smiles. They did not ask me how I was coping. They did not explain risk. They came in, prepared the syringes, told me to roll my sleeve up, and injected me. It took seconds. They left as quickly as they came. I remember standing in the hallway after the door closed and wondering what had just happened.</p>
<p>Weeks later they came back for the second dose. Same speed. Same silence. No conversation about alternatives. No space for consent. Bish, bosh, bang. See you later. That is how it felt. It landed in my body like a judgement.</p>
<p>I tried to keep going. Phone calls. Slow walks with Paddy when I could make it to the door. The thud of footballs next door. The angle grinder from the other side. The house that still smelled wrong no matter what I cleaned.</p>
<p>By July I spoke to Dr Mitchell again. He wrote that my anxiety had worsened and that my diazepam dose needed to increase. He noted that the change was due to several things. The pressure of the pandemic, the lack of progress in my life, and the effects of the Covid vaccination on my physical health. That line stayed with me. It was the first time I saw any acknowledgement on paper that my body had been hit hard. He suggested duloxetine to help reduce the diazepam. He promised a support worker for graded exposure. He wrote that psychological therapy could be considered once I was more stable. Nothing arrived. No support worker. No therapy. Only the pills and the phone.</p>
<p>In my calls with him I tried to name the truth. I said my body was wrecked. I said it felt like something had torn through me. He wondered out loud if the vaccine had triggered my old myalgic symptoms. I did not have the words for what was really happening inside my head. I only had images. I told him it felt like someone had hooked a giant fishhook through the left side of my skull and dragged my nervous system three feet above my body. I could feel myself slipping. Thought by thought. Movement by movement. I was present enough to report it and too unwell to make anyone hear it.</p>
<p>Somewhere in that same window the service changed hands. Dr Mitchell moved on. Continuity vanished. I was handed to a new name on a list. The phone would ring again, but it would not bring someone who knew my voice or the sound of my breathing. It would bring another rotation of scripts and a system that could file me without seeing me.</p>
<p>This is where the floor began to give way.</p>
