<h2>Chapter 2 – Lockdown Exile (May – October 2020)</h2>
<p>From the edge of that hotel bed I tried to build a life again. I bought a van over the phone—cash, delivered to the car park. The driver’s wife followed him in another car and waved as if this were normal. The van became both shelter and symbol: I had wheels, therefore I existed.</p>
<p>I registered the van at Nick’s address, the last fixed point I had, and called the GP surgery there. I rang the Citizens Advice Bureau. Everyone was polite, nobody could help. It was early lockdown; the world had frozen.</p>
<p>The Travelodge was full of ghosts—other displaced souls, addicts, the government’s homeless-relief project. I didn’t feel safe. I moved to another hotel in Frimley that would take Paddy. From there I called every number I could find: councils, crisis teams, mental-health lines. People answered from spare bedrooms, promised to pass messages on. Nothing ever came back.</p>
<p>One day I met a community-mental-health worker named Becky in a park in Godalming. We stood under a bandstand six feet apart, pretending distance was protection. She tried to help but the system was paralysed. Without a permanent address I wasn’t anyone’s responsibility. I understood the logic even as it broke me.</p>
<p>So I made the van my base. When hotels were full, I slept in lay-bys or the edge of a stately-home drive. Paddy curled beside me. I learned how silence can roar when you’re alone long enough.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a house for sale. I’d looked before, back when I’d been staying with Nick, and there was one that had stuck in my mind—a new build with a south-facing garden. By summer 2020 the world was still shuttered, viewings were done by video, but I told myself speed was everything. The sellers were chain-free, I was a cash buyer. My solicitor warned me about the listing—<em>garage and parking</em> that wasn’t really parking—but I was too tired to care.</p>
<p>I completed on October 1st 2020. I drove my own van to collect my storage boxes, loaded everything myself, and moved in. I remember standing in that empty living room, the keys cold in my hand, thinking: <em>I made it. I’m home.</em></p>
<p>The neighbours appeared—Sheila and Dennis from No. 4, David and Christine from No. 8—smiling through the strange fear of lockdown. Sheila warned me, almost kindly, that the summers were “hell” because of the family behind me and their footballs. I laughed politely. Hours later the thud of leather on fence started, and I understood exactly what she meant.</p>
<p>The house smelled wrong—damp, urine, rot. I pulled up carpet, unscrewed sockets, tore into plasterboard hunting for the source. When I realised the soil outside sat above the damp course I smashed half the wall away to see the damage. That night I broke.</p>
<p>David knocked on the door, saw me on the floor amid dust and tears, and sat with me. He could smell it too, could see the ruin the sellers had hidden. For a moment I wasn’t invisible.</p>
<p>The next morning I started patching the hole, lowering the soil, telling myself I could fix everything. I couldn’t, but the act of trying kept me alive a little longer.</p>
