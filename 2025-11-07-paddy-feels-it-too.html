                    There is a stillness in the house that even Paddy can't quite fill.
                    He moves between rooms as if he is searching for something, or someone.
                    Maybe he is looking for her. Maybe he is looking for the way things used to sound
                    when we were all together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His paws tap softly on the floor, a careful rhythm that pauses at doorways and corners.
                    He listens for echoes that do not answer back now. The absence lives in the spaces
                    between his steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has been with us through it all. Every move, every morning routine,
                    every argument that left the air pulled tight around us. He would curl up beside me
                    when I could sleep, lean into my legs when the world felt too sharp. Relentless fireworks are tough on him.
                    Like me, he just wants saftey and peace. (And his ball nudged.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's always trying to hold the middle ground, the quiet center of the house.
                    The invisible thread between two people he loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is softness in his eyes, and something like
                    confusion sitting just behind it. Dogs do not understand endings in human terms.
                    They understand the fading of scent, the shift in routine, the missing presence.
                    They understand the way grief feels in a room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can see it in him. He is grieving too.
                    He waits longer, lingers in the kitchen where her food used to be.
                    Sometimes he lies with his head turned toward the space where she would be,
                    as if some part of him still expects her to walk back into the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe that is what grief really is.
                    Not the logic or the explanation, but the body and the nervous system quietly noticing
                    that someone is no longer here. The mind tries to make sense of it. The heart simply
                    feels what is missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paddy is a living archive of the love that passed through this house.
                    He remembers in the only way he can: through his body, his habits, his instinct to protect
                    and to stay close. He reminds me that what we shared was real,
                    even if the story has collapsed under the weight of waitng.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When he curls up against me now, it feels less like comfort from him to me
                    and more like a shared surrender. Two hearts recalibrating to a new shape of our home.
                    Two beings learning how to live with a silence that did not used to be there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is teaching me that the way through this is not to slam the door on what was
                    or to pretend it meant nothing. The way through is to keep walking slowly
                    through the empty space, together, until it becomes familiar again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's just Paddy and me again.
                    The house feels stripped back to something honest and raw.
                    There is hurt, yes. There is anger and disbelief and the sharp edge of being used.
                    But beneath all of that there is still love, and it has to go somewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, it goes into the simple act of staying.
                    Staying with my own heart. Staying with this dog who has stayed with me
                    through every chapter. Staying with the truth of what happened
                    without needing to rewrite it into something prettier or easier to hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paddy lies under the desk as I write this.
                    His breathing is slow, his body heavy against foot.
                    In his presence I feel a quiet invitation to keep telling the truth,
                    even when it breaks my heart open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe this is how we rebuild again.
                    Not by forgetting, but by letting the parts of us that still know how to love
                    lead us out of the wreckage.
