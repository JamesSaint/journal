          Sebby, I am writing to the place where you might still hear. The boy I met when I was seventeen, the man I knew for two decades, the person who stood beside me in rooms that now feel haunted. I am writing because silence has never kept me safe. Truth has.

      <article>
        <p>
          You knew what my childhood held. You knew the shape of terror in a house that should have been a refuge. You knew my mother died by suicide in 1996, that violence and control eroded hope until there was none left. You watched me try to build a different life out of that wreckage. You knew this, and still you chose harm.
        </p>

        <p>
          We were close once. I excused more than I want to admit, because that is what children of violence learn to do. We minimise, we rationalise, we take the hit and call it friendship. There were times you turned that rage on me. I told myself it was a phase, a bad night, a storm that would pass. It was not. It was character, and it grew.
        </p>

        <p>
          When cocaine and chaos began to circle you, I stepped back. That decision felt like betrayal at the time. It was not. It was the beginning of me choosing life. Years later the headlines made what I already knew impossible to deny. Abigail survived. Her body now tells the story your words never could. Your son will carry his own chapters. None of this should have happened.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, I heard that you died by suicide in a Milwaukee hotel room. By then you had been shunned by the community that once called you friend. The news did not shock me. It landed like a heavy stone on an already cracked floor. The boy I knew, the man who hurt people, the ghost who could not live with what he had done. Three truths, all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have sorrow for the boy, the one who might have been different if someone had interrupted the cycle. I have anger for the man who chose not to. I have a colder, clearer relief that you cannot harm anyone again. All of that is real. I will not pretend otherwise to make you easier to remember.
        </p>

        <p>
          I need you to understand what your choices did inside me. Your violence woke the old rooms in my body. It pressed the bruise of my mother’s last day, it made me small again, it made me doubt my own perception. I am done with that. I am done carrying the weight that belongs to the men who could not love without control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Abigail, and your child, deserve every protection, every resource, every witness who will not look away. They deserve a future that is not defined by your past. I add my voice to that witnessing, and I choose to live mine without the gravity of your shadow.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the release. Not forgiveness that absolves, not vengeance that corrodes, only truth that lets my nervous system stand up straight. I return your life to you, and I return my life to me. I will remember what was good without erasing what was real. I will not name cruelty as love again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wherever you are, if there is any seeing to be done, let it begin with this. You harmed people who trusted you. You harmed me. I say it plainly so that the part of me that once stayed quiet can finally rest. I am alive. I am still here. I am building a home that does not run on fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Goodbye, Seb.

          This letter is a personal witness. It is not a legal document. It exists to name what happened, to acknowledge the impact on Abigail and on a child who did not choose any of this, and to give my body a clean end to a long story.
