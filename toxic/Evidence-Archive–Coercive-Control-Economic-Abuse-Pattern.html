    <h2>Briefing Note – Context for Legal or Clinical Review</h2>

    <p>This evidential archive has been compiled by <strong>James Saint</strong> to provide a chronological, document-based record of his relationship with <strong>Dr Joanna Michalska</strong>, spanning <strong>January – November 2025</strong>. It contains contemporaneous emails, signed agreements, time-stamped screenshots, and photographs that illustrate patterns of psychological manipulation, coercive control, and economic exploitation. The material is presented neutrally and in sequence to assist professional assessment under the <em>Serious Crime Act 2015 § 76</em> (Controlling or Coercive Behaviour) and the <em>Domestic Abuse Act 2021</em> (Economic Abuse).</p>

    <p>From the outset of the relationship, James made full and explicit disclosure that he was <strong>medically retired and without financial means</strong>. This was <strong>knowingly accepted by Jo</strong>, who held a senior executive position as <strong>Executive Director at J.P. Morgan</strong>, and who confirmed her intentions clearly: <em>“If I wanted a man with money, I know plenty. I want a man who is emotionally available and loving as you.”</em> That understanding established a role-reversed arrangement in which James provided domestic, emotional, and administrative care, and Jo provided financial stability. The evidence that follows demonstrates how that agreed balance was later eroded through withdrawal of support, manipulation, and neglect of duty of care, resulting in measurable psychological, financial, and physical harm.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To support informed professional review by legal counsel, investigators, or clinicians. All statements are made in good faith and supported by contemporaneous documentation.</p>

      <h2>Framing Summary</h2>

      <p><strong>Period Covered:</strong> January–November 2025<br>
      <strong>Parties:</strong> James Saint and Dr Joanna Michalska<br>
      <strong>Nature of Relationship:</strong> Cohabiting, engaged partnership characterised by role reversal - James assuming domestic, administrative, and emotional care responsibilities; Jo occupying financial and professional leadership.</p>

      <p>From the outset, James clearly disclosed that he was <strong>medically retired</strong> and without significant financial resources. This was fully understood and accepted by Jo, who at the time held a <strong>senior executive role as Executive Director at J.P. Morgan</strong>. She explicitly stated, “<em>If I wanted a man with money, I know plenty. I want a man who is emotionally available and loving as you.</em>” That acknowledgment formed the relational baseline - that James’s contribution would be emotional, domestic, and supportive, while Jo’s would be financial and structural.</p>

      <p>During this period, Jo extended certain financial instruments in her name to James, including an <strong>American Express (“Black”) credit card</strong> and a <strong>Revolut joint account</strong>. Although these were presented as shared resources, they were rarely used by James due to relational volatility and the sense that financial autonomy was unsafe or uncertain. This dynamic underpins the assessment of <strong>economic control and dependency</strong>.</p>

      <p>This archive evidences a progressive pattern of <strong>coercive control</strong>, <strong>psychological abuse</strong>, and <strong>economic exploitation</strong>. It chronicles the breakdown of reciprocity, disregard for wellbeing, and violation of mutually agreed commitments documented in the signed Relationship Agreement of 18 July 2025.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This archive is compiled in good faith as a factual record of lived experience. It supports potential review under <strong>Section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015</strong> (controlling or coercive behaviour) and the <strong>Domestic Abuse Act 2021</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Contextual Note:</strong> The disclosure and acceptance of financial disparity establish that any later withholding of support represented a change in agreed relational terms, not a continuation of equal standing.</p>

      <strong>James Saint</strong> and <strong>Dr Joanna Michalska</strong> during their engagement and cohabitation
      (January – November 2025). From the beginning, it was understood that James, being medically retired, brought no financial capital to the relationship; Jo, as a high-earning <strong>Executive Director at J.P. Morgan</strong>, accepted full financial leadership within a mutually respectful, role-reversed arrangement. The evidence below shows how those terms were later destabilised through volatility, withdrawal, and disregard.</p>

      <h2>Summary of Pattern of Abuse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychological Control:</strong> Cycles of withdrawal and invalidation fostered dependency. Distress reframed as instability, deepening imbalance.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong> Unpaid domestic and administrative labour under false premise of partnership. Shared accounts offered nominally but practically restricted.</li>
        <li><strong>Neglect of Duty of Care:</strong> Awareness of health vulnerability met with inconsistency and disregard.</li>
        <li><strong>Idealisation → Devaluation:</strong> Engagement and promise followed by rejection and hostility, reflecting coercive cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Documented Harm:</strong> Psychological trauma, health regression, and financial depletion evidenced across records.</li>
