                <ul>
                    <li>Residence period: February to October 2025.</li>
                    <li>Agreed contribution toward household and living costs.</li>

            <h2>Position</h2>
            <div class="card-like">
                <p>I consider this matter closed from my side unless payment or communication is forthcoming. <br><br>This entry will serve as the definitive record for future reference.</p>
                <p>On 1 November 2025, the joint account was formally closed. This completes the financial disentanglement.</p>
                <p>In addition, arrangements must now be made for the collection of [J]'s remaining personal belongings. <br><br>Packing has been completed <strong>1 November 2025</strong> as previously advised (24 October 2025). <br><br>Collection should take place at a neutral public location: <br> <br><strong>Stansted Park, <br>Rowlands Castle, <br>Hampshire, <br>England, <br>PO9 6DX</strong>. <br><br>A proposed date and time should be provided for confirmation of availability.</p> 
                <p>Regarding the supplementary credit card provided; it was used solely for shared purchases during the period of relationship &amp; cohabitation.</p>
                <p>All recent correspondence, dated 23 – 31 October 2025, confirms mutual recognition of closure. The other party acknowledged receipt of communications and accepted the 1 November 2025 arrangement for packing &amp; subsequent collection of belongings. <br><br>This record now constitutes the final administrative and relational closure of all shared matters.</p>

  <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
  <div class="card-like">
<p>The following reflection represents my personal experience and perception of events. It is included here solely to preserve an accurate record of how I lived and understood them.</p>
<p>I entered this relationship in good faith, simply to give love and to be met in love. What I met instead was avoidance disguised as reflection. Each time she withdrew to “take space to process,” it left me holding the relationship alone, carrying both sides of the emotional labour. This has been the fifth cycle of the same pattern, and I see it very clearly now.</p>
<p>I did not come here to manage someone else’s detachment, legacy guilt, shame, or inability to face themselves, nor to be pulled back into a loops of manipulation and gaslighting that only feed exhaustion. I came to build something grounded, mutual, and real. The hurt caused to me runs deep, but I will not let it define me. I have acted with integrity and clarity, documented truthfully, and stayed honest even when met with silence. This is my final line, written in relief. The pattern of behaviour I experienced ends here.</p>
