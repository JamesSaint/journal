          <p>
            It is strange how a single sentence on headed paper can rearrange four years of my life.
            For a long time I have carried this quiet, stubborn knowing that something catastrophic
            happened in my body after that injection in 2021. I felt it. I watched my own system
            fold in on itself. I knew I nearly died, alone in this house, while everyone around me
            seemed to carry on as if nothing serious had happened.
          </p>

          <p>
            There were no blue lights. No dramatic rescues. Just me, on the floor, trying to work
            out whether  I would still be here by morning.
            The violence was internal and invisible, which made it easy for other people to diminish.
            When the world cannot see a wound, it often decides it is not there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, the dismissal became a second injury. Each raised eyebrow, each minimising note,
            each attempt to explain away what my body was clearly broadcasting chipped away at my sense
            of reality. The message was simple and brutal: what you feel is not real, what you know
            about your own body does not count here. I learned to keep going inside that silence,
            but it came at a cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, reading a promenant consultant neurologists final letter, something lands that I have been holding my breath
            for since 2021. After full exhaustive radiological imaging, cardiovascular consultants. extensive lab work, MDT review have
            exhausted all possible other causes, has written that my original problem started with a 'AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine-related neurological injury.''
            It is not everything, but it is enough. It anchors the chaos in a single,
            clear line of causation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The feeling is not triumph. It is a mix of relief, sadness and a kind of quiet rage that
            has nowhere left to go. Relief, because the medical record now reflects the reality I have
            been living. Sadness, because recognition arrives years too late to save the person I was
            before all this. Quiet rage, because none of the nights alone, none of the panic, none of
            the lost work or relationships will be returned to me by a paragraph on Cromwell Hospital letterhead.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was lied to, and coerced into doing the responsible thing, trusting a system that did not have the capacity or
            willingness to hold what would happen next. No one warned me that my life might split into
            a before and an after. 'Safe &amp; Effective' was the narrative. No one told me that if I was unlucky and harmed, I would probably
            have to prove it on my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet here I am. I did keep myself alive long enough for the evidence to catch up. I gathered
            records, chased referrals, went for scans, wrote letters when my brain could barely string
            a sentence together. I built timelines and exhibits because I could not bear the thought
            of the truth being buried under other people’s discomfort for the truth. That work has been exhausting,
            but it has also been its own form of self respect.
          </p>

          <p>
            This recognition does not heal my nervous system or remove the pain, but it does something
            important inside me. It tells the part of me that has been doubting and replaying every moment:
            you were not mistaken, you were not dramatic, you were not weak. You were harmed in the course
            of care, and you fought to stay alive in a landscape that would rather you disappear quietly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tonight, I will not try to make meaning beyond that. I do not have to forgive anyone or rush
            into legal strategy in this exact moment. I am allowed to simply sit with the fact that
            what happened has been named. My body has been witnessed on paper. A promenant senior clinician has
            said out loud and clear what I have been saying all along.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was injured. Badly. I survived. Alone. But I am not invisible anymore,
            at least not to the record. That matters. It might be the smallest kind of justice,
            but it is still justice. And for the first time in a long time, I feel a thin thread
            of ease in my chest, as if some part of me can finally stop arguing with reality and
            simply breathe into my in truth and witness others seek their own.
          </p>
          <p>I remain in pain. I remain alone.</p>
