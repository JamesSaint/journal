    <section class="section card-like">
      <p>There’s a different kind of silence that follows the collapse of something sacred. It isn’t anger anymore. It’s not even disbelief. It’s the slow, heavy stillness of someone who gave everything real and is left sitting in the echo, wondering how love can be felt so fully on one side and fade so easily on the other.</p>
      <p>I wanted love to be a living thing,  given freely, received in reciprocity, woven from presence rather than performance. I wanted it to be felt in the spaces between words, not negotiated in paragraphs or reduced to numbers.</p>
      <p>I think what hurts most isn’t the loss of a person, but the loss of what I <strong>believed</strong> was mutual. That invisible thread I thought was holding us together turns out to have only ever been anchored at my end.</p>
      <p>Still, I wouldn’t un-feel any of it. Because even in the ruins, I know I loved cleanly. And that matters.</p>
      <p>I’ll carry forward the part of me that still believes in love as something sacred. not naive, not blind, but open. I’ll build a life where I don’t have to prove my worth to be met, where tenderness isn’t something I have to earn.</p>
      <p>For now, I’ll let the sadness do its work. It’s honest, and it’s mine.</p>
