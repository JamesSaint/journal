        <p>Today has been horrific. [Redacted]'s cold, defensive emails. [Redacted]'s managerial concern. Two people who once claimed to care, speaking at me from behind walls.</p>
        <p>I reached the edge three days ago, a place I do not know how I survived, and still there is no tenderness, no awareness of what that means. They talk of psychiatric assessments and hospitals, offers of taking 'care' of Paddy  as if my pain is an inconvenience to be managed by a professional abuser a.k.a a "Doctor", rather than a life they helped break.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>The truth is, I feel destroyed. By my health. My family. My friendships. My relationships. By humanity itself.</p>
        <p>I have tried so hard. I have given love, care, truth. I have stayed kind while being dismissed, gaslit, and rewritten. The only being who has truly seen that, who knows how hard I have tried, is Paddy. He has been here through every night of pain, every collapse, every breath that still finds its way out of my chest.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>A mirror the world refuses</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>What haunts me tonight is this question: why do I seem to scare the world so much? It is not my weakness. It is my truth.</p>
        <p>I hold up a mirror people do not want to look into. My honesty exposes what so many avoid: grief, lies, and the violence hidden in love. My pain makes them see what they refuse to face in themselves, so they turn away and likely judge me as 'unstable' or 'too much' to silence the mirror.</p>
        <p>But I am not too much. I am simply what is real. Maybe that is what the world cannot bear, someone who still tells the truth even after being broken by it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Tonight I sit with Pad, feeling the weight of it all. There is nothing to fix, only to witness. I will breathe, feel his warmth against by body, and let the truth live here on this page so it does not have to stay trapped inside me.</p>
