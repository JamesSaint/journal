        <p>This framework places one family's truth inside a wider public shift. For decades, the link between coercive control, institutional minimisation, and self-inflicted death was sidelined or denied. Today, UK law, policy, and policing practice increasingly acknowledge that domestic abuse can kill without leaving fingerprints. These references ground that reality so survivors and families are not told to keep quiet or carry it alone.</p>
