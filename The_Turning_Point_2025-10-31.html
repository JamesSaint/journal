      <h2 id="context-heading">Context</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>This was written in the quiet that followed months of reckoning. It marks the point where I stopped mistaking chaos for connection, and realised that love can change you without needing to continue. What was once about her has become about truth, about seeing what I kept trying to heal in others instead of in myself.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="turning-heading">
      <h2 id="turning-heading">The Turning Point</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I can see it now: what we called love was also a field of wounds meeting each other. She was trying to escape her past; I was trying to redeem mine. We met at the point where need looked like devotion, where promises felt like healing, and where my patience disguised its own exhaustion.</p>
        <p>Every time I left, I was hoping she would finally choose truth over fear. Every time she returned, I told myself this time would be different. But what was different was me. Each return wore down the illusion a little more until the last goodbye did not feel like a collapse. It felt like exhaling the years of holding.</p>
        <p>I do not hate her. I do not even blame her. She is a mirror of where I came from, the chaos I was trained to soothe, the love I was taught to earn. We changed each other’s lives, yes. Not by staying, but by showing what could no longer survive between us.</p>
        <p>I leave this not as a loss but as a threshold. Whatever comes next will have to meet me in truth, not trauma. And for the first time, I think I finally will too.</p>

      <h2 id="clarity-heading">Clarity and Accountability</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>All along, I saw it. I named what was happening, even when she could not. From the start, I set my intentions clearly, to move slowly, to let truth precede touch, to give the bond time to prove its worth before crossing into intimacy. I said I did not want to hold hands, to kiss, to blur boundaries before trust had form.</p>
        <p>But she pushed through, and I let her. That was my first act of self betrayal, not in loving her, but in abandoning the part of me that asked to be protected.</p>
        <p>Through the year that followed, I spoke the truth again and again. I asked for therapy, for accountability, for real repair. I left when promises dissolved into silence. I returned when hope convinced me words might finally become deeds.</p>
        <p>I see now that her healing never truly began. Her sessions circled her work, her image, her validation, not the relational patterns that kept harming those closest to her. And though I can empathise with the trauma that made her choose achievement over attachment, that empathy no longer blinds me to choice. She had one, as I did.</p>
        <p>My responsibility lies not in her avoidance, but in the moments I overrode my own knowing. And yet, within that, I honour myself, for the way I kept bringing truth to the surface, for the man who refused to disappear, even inside distortion.</p>
