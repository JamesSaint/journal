    <h1>Naming What It Was</h1>

    <section class="card-like">
      <p>Today I am calling things by their real names. For too long I softened the language to make it sound survivable, to make her behaviour seem explainable. It was not. It was <strong>coercive control</strong> wrapped in love, <strong>psychological abuse</strong> dressed as concern, <strong>economic abuse</strong> disguised as shared responsibility, and <strong>healthcare abuse</strong> through neglect, manipulation, and obstruction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Coercive control</h2>
      <p>Coercive control looked like subtle rules about what was acceptable to feel, say, or need. It was the constant monitoring of tone, timing, and compliance. Every attempt to assert my truth became a new accusation of instability. The net effect was fear and self doubt rather than safety and choice.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Psychological abuse</h2>
      <p>Psychological abuse was the erosion of self trust. Gaslighting until I questioned my own perceptions. Twisting empathy into guilt. Turning care into obligation. It trained my nervous system to live in anticipation rather than peace. My clarity was replaced by confusion. My calm was replaced by hypervigilance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Economic abuse</h2>
      <p>Economic abuse showed up as promises of shared partnership followed by withdrawal. I managed the home, logistics, and her wellbeing while my own financial footing collapsed. My labour was invisible. My resources were quietly drained. When I finally spoke of fairness I was met with 'I'll review' and silence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Healthcare abuse</h2>
      <p>Healthcare abuse happened when she knew I was unwell and used access, authorisation, or withholding of support as leverage. Decisions about my care were delayed, undermined, or tied to compliance. My health became another place where control was exercised. That is not love. That is harm.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card-like">
      <p>I see now that love is not meant to deplete, confuse, or disable. It is not meant to leave someone medically and financially ruined while claiming to have been trying.</p>
      <p>Today I stop trying to understand her sickness at the expense of my own health. I will use the words that fit, because truth is the only medicine I have left.</p>
