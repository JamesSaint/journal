    <h1>What I Need in Our Relationship</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Emotional presence:</strong> I need you to attune to me emotionally, not just physically show up. I want you to notice, ask, and engage with what’s going on inside me.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual prioritization:</strong> I want us to treat each other’s needs and dreams with equal importance — not mine always second to yours or your kids’. I need to feel like a partner, not an afterthought.</li>
      <li><strong>Commitment to shared growth:</strong> I need us both actively engaging in personal work — therapy, honest conversations, practices for conflict and connection. I don’t want a relationship stuck in old patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect for my chosen role:</strong> I want to contribute as homemaker, emotional anchor, and partner. I need that to be seen and valued as equal, not lesser because it doesn’t earn money.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear financial agreements:</strong> I need us to create explicit agreements so I can spend on my needs without guilt or constant approval. I want financial autonomy within our shared plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Erotic and relational polarity:</strong> I need our erotic life to feel intentional, alive, and safe. I want my sacred submission and bisexuality to be embraced and celebrated, not hidden or tolerated.</li>
      <li><strong>Boundaries around legacy dynamics:</strong> I need you to acknowledge and own the impact of your relationships with your kids and ex on me. I want clear agreements on what’s healthy for us both.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared vision:</strong> I want us to consciously create our life together — where we live, how we spend time, our financial plans, our relational agreements — rather than drifting or reacting to outside forces.</li>
    </ol>
