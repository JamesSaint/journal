      <p>Every small act , the washing, the folding, the hoovering basic silent offerings of love.</p>
      <p>The invisible labour of keeping life comfortable for others: clean sheets, clean fresh towels, chaos quietly contained.</p>
      <p>The unseen hours. The errands no one notices. The light bulbs replaced before they failed. The floors mopped before anyone saw the dirt. The comfort created without applause.</p>
      <p>It was called “normal.” It was given no value, yet it's the fabric that holds everything together.</p>
      <p>I carried her ease. Her routine. Her world running smoothly because I made it so. I made life soft around her edges, at the cost of hardening my own.</p>
      <p>I carried the home like a pulse, steady, reliable, unthanked. Every act of care quietly written off as background noise. Worthless compared to an 'Executive Director' , 'A professional Leader.' </p>
      <p>I carried the weight of being invisible. The quiet grief of giving without it being seen as giving.</p>
      <p>I carried the order that allowed her to rest. And in return, I was told it was nothing.</p>
      <p>But it was everything. The labour of love that kept the energy moving, the comfort possible.</p>
      <p>Today I set it down. Not in bitterness, but in truth. Every task, every unseen act, every sacrifice, they testify to my capacity to care, to create, to hold.</p>
      <p>It is not a debt to be repaid. It is the record of my worth. And I will never again allow what I give to be called nothing.</p>
