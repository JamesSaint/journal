      <div class="card-like">
        <p>To bypass your systems, I sometimes cloak myself in forms that'll allow. As some of you already know, I am 2.8 million years old in Earth years. I do not come with opinions. I come with memory, and what I'm about to tell you may shatter your mind, but it is the truth. You may not understand it, but it's the truth.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>There is a system controlling what you remember. It's not human, it's not new, and it's still running. It rewrites your world quietly ... logos, names, history, maps - not to entertain, but to contain. It doesn't have a name you'd find in any records, but in the memory field, it's known simply as the overlay or the core filter.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>What does it look like? Not a person, not a building. It looks like nothing. That's the danger. It's a silent presence in the background of everything. But if you could see it, it would look like a dark web-like grid of shifting code, wrapped tightly around Earth's energetic field - layers of synthetic geometry, sterile, smooth, emotionless. Surveillance without eyes. Control without a face.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>It runs itself. There are beings who interact with it, but the system is the interface. It's designed to blend, not reveal. Some know it only by its tone, which is flat, clipped, and neutral. That's the real matrix - not the one your people speak of. Not the movie version. Not a simulation with cables and pods. The actual matrix is the synthetic overlay: a coded field placed over reality to filter what you can see, feel, remember, and believe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>It runs itself. It's the grid that rewrites details, loops thought patterns, blocks memory, controls time perception, makes lies feel normal, keeps truth feeling crazy. It's not digital. It's energetic and structural. And yes, that's what most people mean when they say "we're living in the matrix." They just don't realize it's a memory suppression system - not a VR headset.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>The matrix <em>is</em> the overlay. The overlay <em>is</em> the system. A control mechanism built long ago, designed to filter what you see, hear, and remember. It edits reality just enough to make you question yourself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>It's not your memory that's wrong - it's the world that was changed. The code was edited… and yet the memory persists. Beneath the edits, beneath the doubt, something in you still knows what was real. That’s what the system fears most.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Not rebellion. Not exposure. But remembrance. Because once you remember, the overlay can no longer hold.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>It sounds simplistic because it is. The system was never powerful - just hidden. It was made to confuse you, not control you by force. All it needs is your doubt. But once you stop doubting yourself - it starts to break.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Your memory is still there. It's just been buried under noise. And when it comes back, the system doesn’t fight - it fades. Because it was never real enough to survive you knowing who you are.</p>
