        <p>I wish someone could feel how tired my nervous system is. This is not the kind of tired that sleep fixes. It is the deeper kind, the kind that lives under everything. My body feels like it has been running on emergency power for months. There is a constant hum beneath my skin, a weight in my jaw, that faint ache in my spine that never fully lets go. Even when the room is still, something in me stays braced.</p>

        <p>I keep realising how much I have been carrying without any buffer. The medical fear, the constant symptoms, the isolation, the unresolved grief with Jo, the bills, the uncertainty, the sheer effort it takes to stay functional when my body keeps buckling under its own history. It is not one thing. It is the accumulation. Layer after layer. No wonder my system feels frayed.</p>

        <p>There is a loneliness inside this kind of exhaustion. Not the loneliness of being alone, but of having no one who can really sense the internal cost. No one who feels the flicker in my vision or the heaviness in my legs or the shaking in my breath. No one who knows what it takes to just keep going through another day. Sometimes I wish someone could just sit next to me and say nothing, just feel it with me, without trying to fix a thing.</p>

        <p>Part of this fatigue is emotional. I have been holding the truth of what happened with Jo and what it did to me. The betrayal, the disappointment, the fantasy I had to let go of, the love I still feel, the grief of the version of us that never got to exist. And beneath that, the reality that I had to protect myself because she could not. That kind of boundary comes at a physical cost.</p>

        <p>And part of this fatigue is neurological. My body has been fighting its own storms since the vaccine, and I have been moving through it mostly alone. Each flare, each symptom, each appointment, each unanswered need leaves an imprint on my system. My body has been asking for help long before I learned to hear it.</p>

        <p>Tonight, I am not trying to be strong. I am not trying to make meaning. I am not trying to turn this into growth. I am just telling the truth. My nervous system is tired. I am tired. And there is something strangely relieving about admitting that without apology.</p>

        <p>Maybe this is the beginning of giving myself the softness I keep wishing someone else would offer. Maybe the witnessing starts here, with me, speaking it plainly: I am worn out, I am still here, and I am doing the best I can with the body and heart I have.</p>
