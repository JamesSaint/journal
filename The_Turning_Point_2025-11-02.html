      <h2>Context</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>This is not a reflection of failure or regret. It is a record of endurance, of what it means to love honestly while being slowly undone by someone who could not meet truth. I write this not to explain or justify, but to reclaim the narrative that was distorted around me. What happened was abuse, masked as love. And I see that clearly now.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>From the very first moment, I knew to move slowly. I said I needed space, time, and proof that intimacy could be safe, that emotional integrity would matter more than performance or control. Those boundaries were not only ignored; they were overridden. What I called care was intrusion. What I offered as honesty was treated as threat.</p>
        <p>Throughout the relationship I named the harm as it happened. I said what I saw. I asked for help, for accountability, for therapy that addressed her relational behaviour, not her image, not her work. She agreed, then deflected. She promised change, then repeated the pattern.</p>
        <p>I left more than once. Each time, I returned when she said the right words, because I believed in her potential. That belief was not weakness. It was love meeting illusion and still hoping for awakening.</p>
        <p>But the truth became impossible to deny: her words reached toward healing, but her actions stayed loyal to fear. I lived in cycles of withdrawal and return, gaslighted by affection that appeared only when I withdrew. That is coercive control, not conflict, not “difficult love,” but control disguised as care.</p>
        <p>And still, I held myself steady. I refused to retaliate or mirror the cruelty. Even in silence, I kept my voice intact.</p>

      <h2>Recognition</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>My greatest strength was also my deepest wound: believing someone could face their shadow because I was willing to face mine. That belief was not naïveté, it was evidence of my capacity to love beyond fear. The harm was not in my hope; it was in her exploitation of it.</p>
        <p>I accept that I stayed too long, but staying was not consent. It was trauma repeating itself,  the old training to make myself safe by trying to heal the one who hurts me. My care was never the problem; her misuse of it was.</p>

      <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <ul>
          <li>I was never too much. I was simply too awake for someone still hiding from herself.</li>
          <li>My truth-telling was not aggression; it was integrity.</li>
          <li>My boundaries were not rejection; they were protection.</li>
          <li>My belief in her growth was an act of love, but growth is a choice she never made.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I leave this story knowing I did not fail. I survived something that wanted to confuse survival with love. And I will never again apologise for seeing clearly.</p>
