        <p><strong>Dear Mum,</strong></p>

        <p>I think you would understand what happened today. You would probably be sad that it has come to this, and you would also know why it had to. I finally did the thing you never got to do: I stopped letting their version of family crush what is real in me.</p>

        <p>I can see now how lonely it must have been for you, trying to make sense of people who could not meet you. I used to think that if I explained enough or softened enough they might change. They do not. They double down on their stories.</p>

        <p>Today I chose peace over performance. It does not mean I do not love the idea of family. It means I am done sacrificing myself to it.</p>

        <p>I miss you. I wish you had someone who could have held you the way you needed. Maybe the best thing I can do for both of us is to stop letting that same coldness reach me now.</p>

        <p>Love,<br/><strong>James xx</strong></p>
