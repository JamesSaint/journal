    </header>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I want to witness that I tried. I tried to protect myself from the dark energies that wear human faces yet withhold the simple warmth that makes us human. I can hold the reality that people act from trauma and coping strategies. I can also hold that harm is harm when promises are made and care is not delivered.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Box Hill</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Our first date was a long walk at Box Hill, then coffee until the shop closed. We walked back to the cars and said goodbye. We hugged. What happened next imprinted something in me. The embrace continued. Ten minutes. Twenty. Thirty. The road fell quiet. Rain began to fall and still neither of us moved. Forty five minutes of unmoving closeness beside two parked cars, water in our hair, breath on skin. My body registered safety. My nervous system said, this is home.</p>
        <p>That was the first dose. It felt pure and it felt true. I kept looking for it again.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Imprint and the Cycle</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>After that night I did not chase fantasy. I chased a memory. Small doses arrived. A passionate kiss that left us both quiet. When I asked what she felt, she said fear. I understood that fear. I had tenderness for it. I also learned that fear, left unworked, chooses self preservation over reciprocity. Words made promises that actions did not keep. That is where the hurt set in.</p>
        <p>What formed between us was a loop. Closeness. Panic. Distance. Ache. Repeat. Her fear of being engulfed met my longing for steady connection. Both of us became loyal to the pattern even when we wished for something softer.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Six Days</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>She came to stay. I expected one night, maybe two. She stayed six. She worked from here yet was strikingly available. Present. Attentive. She said she fell in love that week. I felt myself fall too. It was another strong dose. It convinced me that we were building something that could hold us. I let it root in me.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Breadcrumbs and Longing</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Across the year I received breadcrumbs. Enough to keep hope alive. Not enough to build a life. The disparity became the ache. I offered presence, patience, depth. I asked for reciprocity. I asked for the same shelter I was giving.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>On Choice and Accountability</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>Cliff said my picker was off. I bristled at that. A year later I see the part that is true. Not because I seek punishment or blame. The first dose made a promise to my nervous system. I kept trying to collect the rest of that promise from a woman whose capacity could not match her words. I accept my part in staying. I refuse to condemn myself for wanting love to be real.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What I Tried</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I stayed open when closing would have been easier. I spoke plainly when silence would have cost me less. I chose care, again and again, even when my body was in pain and my heart was tired. I was loyal to what we could have been. I did not abandon my longing. That is something I respect in myself.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
      <div class="card-like">
        <p>I know how powerful first contact can be. I know how rare it is for chemistry to become consistency. I know that I deserve reciprocity that is not rationed out as a reward. I know that love without steadiness is a series of highs and withdrawals. I choose steady now.</p>
        <p>This is not a takedown. It is a record. It is how the imprint was made and how I carried it. It is me saying, with no performance, that I tried.</p>
