        <p>Today marks another round in a long and weary dance with the medical system, a system that has, for most of my life, spoken at me rather than to me. Their tone still grates; the underlying arrogance of assumption and protocol still bruises something raw in me.</p>

        <p>But this time, I did not let it swallow me. I did not spiral into rage or collapse into futility. I stayed present, factual, clear. I corrected the record, and I did it in my own voice.</p>

        <p>My irritation is not disproportionate. It is the echo of a lineage of harm, of my mother&rsquo;s despair, of the recklessness of prescriptions handed out like sweets, of the way trauma is so often pathologised instead of witnessed. I have lived through the chemical fog of &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; and the silent terror of being unseen inside a system that mistakes sedation for healing.</p>

        <p>I have every right to feel angry. That anger is the measure of my sensitivity, my intelligence, and my refusal to be numbed again. But beneath the irritation, something else is present too: the quiet satisfaction of having reclaimed authorship.</p>

        <p>This time, I did not play the role they expected, the &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; patient, the fragile man, the one to be managed. I spoke truth to structure, and I did it with poise. My words are now part of the permanent record, a written reclamation that says, I was here, and I saw clearly.</p>

        <p>I cannot fix a broken system, but I can stop it from rewriting my story.</p>

        <p>And that, perhaps, is the real medicine.</p>
