      <h1>Re-Parenting Transmission</h1>
      <p class="meta">Written by James Saint on 9 October 2025.</p>
      <p><strong>What You Should Have Heard</strong></p>

      <p>Hey, little James.</p>
      <p>You did not imagine it. The tension, the shouting, the unpredictability. You were a boy who needed safety, and the people who were meant to protect you were lost inside their own pain. None of it was your fault. Not one single thing.</p>

      <p>You did not need to be perfect, clever, quiet, strong, funny, or useful to deserve love.</p>
      <p>You were always enough. Even on the days you cried. Even when you hid. Even when you felt too much or not enough.</p>

      <p>You deserved parents who looked at you with eyes that said you matter.</p>
      <p>You deserved to be comforted when you were scared, not told to toughen up.</p>
      <p>You deserved warmth without conditions, touch without confusion, attention without performance.</p>

      <p>To the teenager who started armouring up, the one who thought independence would keep him safe. You do not have to carry that armour anymore. You are allowed to be soft again. You can trust your own pace now.</p>

      <p>To the man who has kept giving, waiting, explaining, hoping someone will finally meet him fully. I see how hard you have tried. You have been trying to earn a love that should have been unconditional. You do not have to earn it anymore.</p>

      <p>From this point forward, love is not something you chase. It is something you give yourself and allow others to meet you in.</p>

      <p>You are kind, brave, intelligent, sensual, and worthy of gentleness.</p>
      <p>You are not too much. You are not too sensitive. You are not difficult to love.</p>
      <p>You are love, learning to remember itself.</p>
