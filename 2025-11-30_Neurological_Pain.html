      <h2>Why I am writing this</h2>
      <p>
        I am writing this tonight because the pain in my head and nervous system is not something I can keep carrying silently.
        My body feels like it is being slowly burned and compressed from the inside. I want a clear record of what this actually
        feels like, beyond the tick-box questions and minimising language I meet in most clinical rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is for me first. To be able to look back and say: it was this bad. I was not exaggerating. I was not simply anxious.
        My life was being bent around constant neurological pain.

      <h2>Head and neck pain</h2>
      <p>
        The pain at the back of my head is a constant ache with spikes of sharp, electric pressure. It often feels like someone
        has clamped a metal band around the base of my skull and is slowly tightening it. When it flares, I feel a stabbing
        pressure in the occipital area that makes it hard to keep my head upright.
      </p>
      <p>
        My neck feels strained and vulnerable, as if one wrong movement will tip something over the edge. At times the pain
        runs from the skull down through the neck and along the spine, like a hot line that will not cool down.
      </p>

      <h2>Facial, sensory and visual symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        There is often a numb, heavy, or buzzing feeling along the left side of my face and head. Sometimes it moves into my
        ear and jaw so that chewing or even talking feels like extra work. My ear pressure comes and goes and can make the
        whole left side of my head feel blocked and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vision can feel strained and unstable. Focusing on a screen or reading for too long makes the pain build behind my
        eyes and deep in my head. At times it feels like my brain is lagging behind what I am seeing, as if the signals are
        delayed or fighting through fog.
      </p>

      <h2>Spinal, leg and pelvic pain</h2>
      <p>
        The pain is not only in my head. There is a line down my spine that feels inflamed and irritated. My left leg, foot,
        groin and genital area can feel numb, burning, or both at once. Sometimes it is a deep internal ache, other times it
        is sharp, electric and raw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking or standing for too long increases the symptoms. Sitting for too long also increases the symptoms. There is
        no fully comfortable position. Every choice has a cost. My body feels like a territory that no longer has any safe
        ground, only slightly less hostile zones.
      </p>

    <section class="journal-section">
      <h2>Impact on daily life</h2>
      <p>
        The pain shapes everything. Simple tasks like washing, cooking, or taking Paddy out feel like small expeditions that
        I have to plan around my energy and pain levels. Leaving the house is not a casual decision. It is a calculation about
        whether my head and nervous system can tolerate the effort and the sensory load.
      </p>
      <p>
        My world has shrunk. I am alone at home most of the time, unable to rely on my body or the medical system. The pain
        is not only physical. It brings a constant emotional weight: grief for the life I had, anger at the harm that was done,
        fear about how long this will go on, and a deep loneliness in being the only one who can feel what is happening inside
        my nervous system.

      <h2>Emotional state tonight</h2>
      <p>
        Tonight I feel exhausted, angry and very tender. There is a part of me that wants to give up and stop trying to explain
        any of this to anyone. There is another part that is still fighting to be treated
        as a human being in pain rather than a problem to be moved along.
      </p>
<!--       <p>
        I am tired of being told this is anxiety, stress, relationship troubles, or anything that avoids the reality that a
        vaccine injury has left me with long term neurological damage. It is easier for systems and professionals to doubt
        my experience than to confront what that would actually mean.

      <h2>Closing for tonight</h2>
      <p>
        I am ending this entry because my head is hurting more from the focus it took to write it. The pain is still here. I will
        try to rest now and hope that tomorrow brings at least a small shift in the intensity, or one person who is willing to
        truly listen.
