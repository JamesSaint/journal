    <section class="card-like">
      <p>For too long I told myself that her cruelty was unconscious, that her emotional absence was trauma and not choice. I believed that if I held enough compassion, she would meet me halfway.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Unconsciousness versus refusal to look</h2>
      <p>What I called unconsciousness was, in effect, refusal. A pattern of evasion so deep it masqueraded as innocence. The dismissive avoidant stance, cold, intellectual, detached,  becomes psychological warfare when paired with power and control. The result is not a simple misunderstanding. It is harm.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Ignorance does not excuse harm</h2>
      <p>Ignorance may explain behaviour, but it does not excuse it. Not in ethics, and not under law. When one person’s denial dismantles another person’s safety, stability, and autonomy, it meets the definition of abuse even if the perpetrator insists they did not mean it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Patterns that hide in plain sight</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Charm masking contempt.</li>
        <li>Logic weaponised to erase feeling.</li>
        <li>Empathy simulated rather than lived.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These patterns leave the victim doubting reality, apologising for needing care, and shrinking until survival replaces self.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Cost to body, mind, and resources</h2>
      <p>I carry neurological, psychological, and financial scars from that dynamic. They are not metaphors. They are the physiological imprint of sustained coercion, gaslighting, and neglect. My nervous system is still learning that it is safe.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card-like">
      <p>This entry is not revenge. It is record. A reclamation of narrative. It states that what happened was not a relationship simply gone wrong. It was a system of harm maintained through denial.</p>
      <p><strong>Unawareness may be genuine, but harm is harm. Ignorance, however sincere, is not a defence.</strong></p>
